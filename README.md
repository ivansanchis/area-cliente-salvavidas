This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file and ensure the `NEXTAUTH_URL` value matches the origin used in the browser. For local development it usually is:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Also provide a value for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` so that sessions can be decrypted
consistently across server restarts. When developing locally you may simply set
any random string:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=dev-secret
```

If you cannot set a fixed URL during development, set `AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true` so
NextAuth can rely on the request's host header.

If the URL does not match, admin API requests will respond with `401 Unauthorized` because the session cookie will not be sent correctly.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
